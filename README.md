## 🛠️ Installation 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devdignesh/twitter-clone.git
cd twitter-clone
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Environment Variables

Before running the development server, make sure to create `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the required environment variables. You can use the example provided in the repository as a starting point.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Prisma Setup (MongoDB)


#### 1. Generate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```
#### 2. MongoDB Configuration

- The project uses MongoDB, and the connection is defined in the `.env` file. Make sure your `.env` includes the correct MongoDB connection string
``` bash
DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://username:password@xxx.xxx.mongodb.net/twitter_clone"
```

#### 3. Run Prisma Commands

```bash
npx prisma db push
```

## Supabase Setup:
#### 1. Create a Supabase Account

- Visit [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), sign up, and create a new project.
#### 2. Get API Keys

- After creating your project, go to the `API section` or `connect`.
- Find `Project URL` and `API Key/anon key` for the following environment variables:
 ```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```
- Copy these keys and add them to your .env file.

#### 3. Create Public Storage Buckets

- Navigate to Storage in the Supabase dashboard.
- Create three public buckets: `images`, `banners`, and `avatars`.
- Set their public access policies so that users can upload and fetch files. Refer to this [detailed guide](https://blog.stackademic.com/upload-file-using-next-js-and-supabase-ad0af2360677) if you need help with configuring storage policies.

#### 4. Set Permissions for Buckets

- In each bucket, set the policy under `Configuration` to make sure the files can be publicly read.


#### 5. That's it!

Once done, your Supabase setup is complete and your application will now be able to store and retrieve images.
